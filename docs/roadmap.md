# Parable Roadmap

> **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.** This is a reference document maintained by hand.

Features to make Parable more useful for downstream projects.

## Test Suite Status

Parable is tested against bash-oracle (GNU Bash 5.3 patched with `--dump-ast`).

**Current:** 3,643 passed, 565 failed (87% pass rate)

Test corpora:
- **Oils bash corpus:** 2,495 tests
- **tree-sitter-bash corpus:** 93 tests
- **GNU Bash test corpus:** 78 tests
- **Parable hand-written tests:** 1,542 tests

Total: 4,208 tests (4,201 verified against oracle, 7 skipped due to binary content)

---

## P1: Oracle Alignment

Parable's s-expression output must match bash-oracle exactly. Failure classification:

| Count | % | Issue | Fix |
|------:|----:|-------|-----|
| 279 | 49.4% | Corpus tests (mixed issues) | Various oracle format differences |
| 35 | 6.2% | Variable fd `{fd}>` | Strip `{fd}` prefix from redirect operator |
| 31 | 5.5% | Command substitution formatting | Preserve newlines/spacing inside `$(...)` |
| 26 | 4.6% | Pipe stderr `\|&` | Transform to `(redirect ">&" 1)` on prev cmd |
| 25 | 4.4% | ANSI-C quoting `$'...'` | Expand escape sequences (`\n` → newline) |
| 22 | 3.9% | Extglob case patterns | Handle `+(...)`, `*(...)`, etc. in case |
| 16 | 2.8% | For/select edge cases | Implicit `$@`, brace body unwrapping |
| 15 | 2.7% | Obscure edge cases | Unusual syntax combinations |
| 14 | 2.5% | Word edge cases | Empty input, special characters |
| 8 | 1.4% | Select statements | Redirect placement, brace body |
| 8 | 1.4% | If statements | Various formatting differences |
| 93 | 16.5% | Other scattered issues | Misc failures across test files |

## P2: Usability

Features that make Parable practical for tool authors.

### Position tracking (optional)

**Status:** Not implemented

AST nodes have no source location information. Required for:
- Syntax highlighters
- Linters with precise error locations
- IDEs
- Source maps

**Approach:** Store only byte offsets (16 bytes/node). Compute line/column lazily on demand from a line index. Make it opt-in to avoid overhead when not needed.

```python
ast = parse(code, track_positions=True)
node.start_offset  # always available
node.start_line    # computed on first access
node.start_col     # computed on first access
```

**Effort:** Medium

### JSON serialization

**Status:** Not implemented

```python
ast.to_dict()  # For JSON serialization
ast.to_json()  # Direct JSON output
```

**Effort:** Low

### Visitor pattern

**Status:** Not implemented

```python
class MyVisitor(Visitor):
    def visit_CommandSubstitution(self, node):
        print(f"Found command sub: {node}")

visitor = MyVisitor()
visitor.walk(ast)
```

**Effort:** Low

## P3: Nice to Have

Features with narrower use cases.

### Error recovery

**Status:** Not implemented

Parse incomplete/invalid input and return best-effort AST. Required for IDE use cases where code is often in an invalid state.

**Effort:** High (architectural change)

**Downside:** Partial ASTs can confuse downstream tools. Recovery heuristics are brittle.

### Comments preservation

**Status:** Not implemented

Attach comments to AST nodes. Required for formatters and doc generators.

**Effort:** Medium

**Downside:** Lexer rewrite. Ambiguous attachment (does comment belong to preceding or following node?).

### Source reconstruction

**Status:** Not implemented

Reconstruct source from AST: `ast.to_source()`. Required for formatters and refactoring tools.

**Effort:** Medium

**Downside:** Either preserve original whitespace (memory cost) or accept lossy reconstruction. Edge cases with heredocs and quotes.
