# Parable Roadmap

> **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.** This is a reference document maintained by hand.

Features to make Parable more useful for downstream projects.

## Test Suite Status

Parable is tested against bash-oracle (GNU Bash 5.3 patched with `--dump-ast`).

**Current:** 3,643 passed, 565 failed (87% pass rate)

Test corpora:
- **Oils bash corpus:** 2,495 tests
- **tree-sitter-bash corpus:** 93 tests
- **GNU Bash test corpus:** 78 tests
- **Parable hand-written tests:** 1,542 tests

Total: 4,208 tests (4,201 verified against oracle, 7 skipped due to binary content)

## P2: Usability

Features that make Parable practical for tool authors.

### Position tracking (optional)

**Status:** Not implemented

AST nodes have no source location information. Required for:
- Syntax highlighters
- Linters with precise error locations
- IDEs
- Source maps

**Approach:** Store only byte offsets (16 bytes/node). Compute line/column lazily on demand from a line index. Make it opt-in to avoid overhead when not needed.

```python
ast = parse(code, track_positions=True)
node.start_offset  # always available
node.start_line    # computed on first access
node.start_col     # computed on first access
```

**Effort:** Medium

### JSON serialization

**Status:** Not implemented

```python
ast.to_dict()  # For JSON serialization
ast.to_json()  # Direct JSON output
```

**Effort:** Low

### Visitor pattern

**Status:** Not implemented

```python
class MyVisitor(Visitor):
    def visit_CommandSubstitution(self, node):
        print(f"Found command sub: {node}")

visitor = MyVisitor()
visitor.walk(ast)
```

**Effort:** Low

## P3: Nice to Have

Features with narrower use cases.

### Error recovery

**Status:** Not implemented

Parse incomplete/invalid input and return best-effort AST. Required for IDE use cases where code is often in an invalid state.

**Effort:** High (architectural change)

**Downside:** Partial ASTs can confuse downstream tools. Recovery heuristics are brittle.

### Comments preservation

**Status:** Not implemented

Attach comments to AST nodes. Required for formatters and doc generators.

**Effort:** Medium

**Downside:** Lexer rewrite. Ambiguous attachment (does comment belong to preceding or following node?).

### Source reconstruction

**Status:** Not implemented

Reconstruct source from AST: `ast.to_source()`. Required for formatters and refactoring tools.

**Effort:** Medium

**Downside:** Either preserve original whitespace (memory cost) or accept lossy reconstruction. Edge cases with heredocs and quotes.
