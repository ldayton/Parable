# Iteration 5: Redirections - comprehensive edge cases

# === Output redirects ===

=== output redirect

---


=== close after dup
cmd 3>&1 3>&-
---
(command (word "cmd") (redirect ">&" 1) (redirect ">&-" 0))
---


# === Move file descriptor (dup and close) ===

=== move fd input
cmd 3<&0-
---
(command (word "cmd") (redirect "<&" 0))
---


=== move fd output
cmd 3>&1-
---
(command (word "cmd") (redirect ">&" 1))
---


# === Mixed brutal patterns ===

=== multiple combined redirects
cmd &> out1.log 2>&1 &>> out2.log
---
(command (word "cmd") (redirect "&>" "out1.log") (redirect ">&" 1) (redirect "&>>" "out2.log"))
---


=== combined with here string
cmd &> log.txt <<< "input"
---
(command (word "cmd") (redirect "&>" "log.txt") (redirect "<<<" ""input""))
---


=== combined in pipeline
cmd1 &> /dev/null | cmd2
---
(pipe (command (word "cmd1") (redirect "&>" "/dev/null")) (command (word "cmd2")))

=== combined with stderr dup
cmd 2>&1 &> file.log
