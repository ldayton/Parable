# Iteration 16: Negation and Time

# === Pipeline negation ===

=== simple negation
! true
---
(negation (command (word "true")))
---


=== negation of command with args
! grep pattern file
---
(negation (command (word "grep") (word "pattern") (word "file")))
---


=== negation of pipeline
! cmd1 | cmd2
---
(negation (pipe (command (word "cmd1")) (command (word "cmd2"))))
---


=== negation of compound command
! { echo hello; }
---
(negation (brace-group (command (word "echo") (word "hello"))))
---


=== negation of subshell
! (exit 1)
---
(negation (subshell (command (word "exit") (word "1"))))
---


=== negation in list
! true && echo "was false"
---
(and (negation (command (word "true"))) (command (word "echo") (word "\"was false\"")))
---


=== negation in or list
! false || echo "was true"
---
(or (negation (command (word "false"))) (command (word "echo") (word "\"was true\"")))
---


=== negation of if statement
! if true; then false; fi
---
(negation (if (command (word "true")) (command (word "false"))))
---


=== negation of while loop
! while false; do echo x; done
---
(negation (while (command (word "false")) (command (word "echo") (word "x"))))
---


=== negation of for loop
! for i in 1; do false; done
---
(negation (for (word "i") (in (word "1")) (command (word "false"))))
---


# === Time keyword ===

=== simple time
time sleep 1
---
(time (command (word "sleep") (word "1")))
---


=== time with pipeline
time cmd1 | cmd2
---
(time (pipe (command (word "cmd1")) (command (word "cmd2"))))
---


=== time with compound command
time { echo hello; }
---
(time (brace-group (command (word "echo") (word "hello"))))
---


=== time with subshell
time (sleep 1)
---
(time (subshell (command (word "sleep") (word "1"))))
---


=== time with posix flag
time -p sleep 1
---
(time -p (command (word "sleep") (word "1")))
---


# === Combined negation and time ===

=== time with negation
time ! false
---
(negation (time (command (word "false"))))
---


=== negation of time
! time sleep 1
---
(negation (time (command (word "sleep") (word "1"))))
---


=== time negation in list
time ! false && echo done
---
(and (negation (time (command (word "false")))) (command (word "echo") (word "done")))
---


# === Edge cases ===

=== exclamation as word not negation
echo !
---
(command (word "echo") (word "!"))
---


=== exclamation in middle of command
echo hello ! world
---
(command (word "echo") (word "hello") (word "!") (word "world"))
---


=== time as command name when not first
echo time
---
(command (word "echo") (word "time"))
---


=== negation with redirects
! cat < input.txt
---
(negation (command (word "cat") (redirect "<" "input.txt")))
---


=== time with redirects
time cat < input.txt
---
(time (command (word "cat") (redirect "<" "input.txt")))
---


# === Additional edge cases ===

=== double negation
! ! true
---
(command (word "true"))
---


=== negation of case statement
! case x in x) true;; esac
---
(negation (case (word "x") (pattern ((word "x")) (command (word "true")))))
---


=== negation with process substitution
! cat <(echo test)
---
(negation (command (word "cat") (word "<(echo test)")))
---


=== time with process substitution
time cat <(seq 1000000)
---
(time (command (word "cat") (word "<(seq 1000000)")))
---


=== negation in semicolon list
! true; echo after
---
(semi (negation (command (word "true"))) (command (word "echo") (word "after")))
---


=== multiple negations in list
! true && ! false
---
(and (negation (command (word "true"))) (negation (command (word "false"))))
---


=== time of function call
time myfunc arg1 arg2
---
(time (command (word "myfunc") (word "arg1") (word "arg2")))
---


=== negation with here document
! cat <<EOF
content
EOF
---
(negation (command (word "cat") (redirect "<<" "content
")))
---


=== time with here document
time cat <<EOF
content
EOF
---
(time (command (word "cat") (redirect "<<" "content
")))
---


=== exclamation in string is not negation
echo "! not negation"
---
(command (word "echo") (word "\"! not negation\""))
---


=== time in variable is not keyword
cmd=time; $cmd sleep 1
---
(semi (command (word "cmd=time")) (command (word "$cmd") (word "sleep") (word "1")))
